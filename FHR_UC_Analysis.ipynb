    "This project focuses on analyzing fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) data collected from medical devices monitoring labor progress. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data, including detecting key patterns and calculating important statistics, such as identifying peaks in uterine contractions and measuring their duration."
